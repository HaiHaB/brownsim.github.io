                                    Canonically, accelerations of a vehicle in a (fixed) reference frame are translated to
                                    an inertial reference frame before the application of cueing filters. Though useful for
                                    washout, this introduces unwanted cross-axis distortion that scales with simulator capability.
                                    In this paper, a new variant of classical cueing is introduced that nearly eliminates cross-axis
                                    distortion entirely whilst enhancing washout behavior.

									possible to transition from e-sports to actual motor racing. Such models are not entirely accurate
									however. They prioritise stability in order to accommodate even the most unhinged driving, not to
									mention the janky input profile of a keyboard or controller.

                 					Motion simulators operate in limited space. This necessitates routinely recentralising or "washing out"
									the cockpit in order to have room for the next manoeuvre. Ideally, this recentering is carried out at a
									small enough acceleration that it is imperceptible to the driver - too high and the risk of motion sickness
									greatly increases.

									A Nonlinear Extension to Classical Filters for Washout Miscue Prevention</a></div>
								<div class="text-small" style="font-style:italic">Driving Simulation Conference 2023, Antibes, France</div>
                                <p>
                                    The washout or recentering of a motion simulator platform to its neutral or nominal position is guaranteed
									by the numerical properties of classical washout filters. Ideally, the sensation of the platform recentering
									should be imperceptible to the driver at all times-formally that the resulting translational accelerations and
									angular velocities fall below some perception thresholds. Exceeding these can cause an unwanted sensation
									(mis-cue) whose prevention is not guaranteed by linear washout filters-rather, the risk is minimised by careful
									tuning. Nonetheless, even a single miscue can break immersion or accelerate the onset of motion sickness.
									The need to avoid miscues may even lead an operator to compromise overall motion. In this paper, the classical
									washout filter for the acceleration case is refactored as the sum of a 'transient' and 'recentering' signal.
									It is shown the latter is equivalent to the closed loop Proportional Derivative (PD) control of a double integrating system.
									Since the saturated PD control of a double integrator system is known to be globally asymptotically stable,
									saturation may be applied to the 'recentering' signal so it does not exceed some perception threshold. The
									limitations of this approach are discussed.

									A 2nd order high pass filter is commonly applied to translational accelerations in 'classical' motion cueing. An
									additional first order high pass filter is applied to recentre the simulator with constant input, known as washout.
									The practical meaning of the associated parameters is not always intuitive. In this paper an alternative way of
									representing classical washout filters is presented, specifically in terms of leaky integrators. The relationship
									between leak rates and the conventional parameters is given. A step-response based tuning method whereby an operator
									can sweep a single cutoff frequency, intending to approximate the trade off between travel usage and cueing accuracy,
									is provided.

									This paper proposes a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm for unconstrained continuous optimisation problems,
									termed μJADE, that uses a small or ‘micro’ (μ) population. The main contribution of the proposed DE is a new mutation
									operator, ‘current-by-rand-to-pbest.’ With a population size less than 10, JADE is able to solve some classical multimodal
									benchmark problems of 30 and 100 dimensions as reliably as some state-of-the-art DE algorithms using conventionally sized
									populations. The algorithm also compares favourably to other small population DE variants and classical DE.

									Towards Generic-Optimal Domestic Heating Control</a></div>
								<div class="text-small" style="font-style:italic">Doctor of Engineering (EngD), University of Surrey. Submitted 06 September 2016</div>
                                <p>
									Presently, the uncertainties associated with controlling domestic heating system are managed using rule of thumb or heuristic rule-based
									controllers. The problems associated with this are: lack of bespokeness and optimality of the control to each unique building, difficulty
									in comparing technologies due to inconsistent control quality (lack of generality) and the expense of developing controllers for new technologies.
									In this work, the problem of heating system control is generalised with the intent of developing a generic-optimal controller — one that can
									control any set of heat sources in any building optimally, alleviating the aforementioned problems. A hybrid intelligent system design methodology
									is applied in order to develop the (model predictive) controller resulting in two sub-tasks. First, acquiring a model of each heating
									system — identification must be carried out on-line. Second, delivering optimal control using the model, given constraints.  The first is
									tackled by applying Echo State Networks (ESN’s), whose benefits are that they have universal approximation ability, on-line learning is a
									recursive linear regression problem (for which the solution even in low precision environments is well understood), that on-line learning
									can be easily achieved using real feedbacks (network stability is relatively easy to attain) and that they can be easily scaled to systems
									of varying complexity.  The second is tackled by using a global, derivative-free optimiser — meaning that the controller may tackle mixed
									integer problems and incorporate arbitrary output constraints expressed as penalty functions.  A theoretical third problem arises due to the
									interaction of the learning and optimisation components of the controller. A methodology for tackling this is given. When applied to a simulated
									monovalent heating system in an unoccupied house (in the absence of user disturbances) consistent control can be achieved. The effective rejection of
									user disturbances is an outstanding problem and is briefly discussed.

                                    Advanced technical capability is rendered useless without an intuitive user experience. We view the above topics as specialisations within
                                    the software field, rather than a separate discipline. Thus, our integrated approach can take experimental software through to client facing production code.
