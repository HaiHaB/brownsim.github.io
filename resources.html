                                                        <p>In the marketing material for motion simulations, most, if not all, emphasis is placed on physical aspects: workspace size in terms of displacement, velocity and acceleration, latency and so on. Though important, these attributes are only as useful as the motion cueing system is able to exploit. In practice, poorly parametrised Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCA's), (unexpected) driver changes, lack of a dedicated (often part-time) cueing engineer and a lack of pre-session MCA testing severely compromises simulator outcomes. In light of this, ProCue â„¢ was conceived. Drawing on over a decade of simulation experience acquired at McLaren, Toyota Gazoo Racing, dSPACE, Bosch and others, ProCue helps to ensure deployment of the best MCA, with optimal parametrisation, for given simulator(s), scenario(s) and driver(s). Procue may even help you quantify the theoretical benefits of a new simulator prior to purchase. Moreover, given the innumerable permutations of the above, robust experiment management and trace-ability is urgently needed in the motion cueing domain-ProCue frees resource for what really matters: vehicle development..</p>

                                                        <p>The washout or recentering of a motion simulator platform to
                                                            its neutral or nominal position is guaranteed by
                                                            the numerical properties of classical washout filters.
                                                            Ideally, the sensation of the platform recentering
                                                            should be imperceptible to the driver at all times-formally
                                                            that the resulting translational accelerations
                                                            and angular velocities fall below some perception
                                                            thresholds. Exceeding these can cause an unwanted
                                                            sensation (mis-cue) whose prevention is not guaranteed by
                                                            linear washout filters-rather, the risk is
                                                            minimised by careful tuning. Nonetheless, even a single
                                                            miscue can break immersion or accelerate the onset
                                                            of motion sickness. The need to avoid miscues may even lead
                                                            an operator to compromise overall motion. In
                                                            this paper, the classical washout filter for the
                                                            acceleration case is refactored as the sum of a 'transient'
                                                            and 'recentering' signal. It is shown the latter is
                                                            equivalent to the closed loop Proportional Derivative

                                                            saturated PD control of a double integrator system is
                                                            known to be globally asymptotically stable, saturation may
                                                            be applied to the 'recentering' signal so it does
                                                            not exceed some perception threshold. The limitations of

                                                            thresholds. Exceeding these can cause an unwanted
                                                            sensation (mis-cue) whose prevention is not guaranteed by
                                                            linear washout filters-rather, the risk is
                                                            minimised by careful tuning. Nonetheless, even a single
                                                            miscue can break immersion or accelerate the onset
                                                            of motion sickness. The need to avoid miscues may even lead

                                                            this paper, the classical washout filter for the
                                                            acceleration case is refactored as the sum of a 'transient'
                                                            and 'recentering' signal. It is shown the latter is
                                                            equivalent to the closed loop Proportional Derivative

                                                            saturated PD control of a double integrator system is
                                                            known to be globally asymptotically stable, saturation may
                                                            be applied to the 'recentering' signal so it does

                                                    <p>This paper proposes a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm
                                                        for unconstrained continuous optimisation problems, termed
                                                        JADE, that uses a small or â€˜microâ€™ (
                                                        ) population. The main contribution of the proposed DE is a new

                                                    <p>Presently, the uncertainties associated with controlling domestic heating system are managed using rule of thumb or heuristic rule-based controllers. The problems associated with this are: lack of bespokeness and optimality of the control to each unique building, difficulty in comparing technologies due to inconsistent control quality (lack of generality) and the expense of developing controllers for new technologies.  In this work, the problem of heating system control is generalised with the intent of developing a generic-optimal controller â€” one that can control any set of heat sources in any building optimally, alleviating the aforementioned problems. A hybrid intelligent system design methodology is applied in order to develop the (model predictive) controller resulting in two sub-tasks. First, acquiring a model of each heating system â€” identification must be carried out on-line. Second, delivering optimal control using the model, given constraints.  The first is tackled by applying Echo State Networks (ESNâ€™s), whose benefits are that they have universal approximation ability, on-line learning is a recursive linear regression problem (for which the solution even in low precision environments is well understood), that on-line learning can be easily achieved using real feedbacks (network stability is relatively easy to attain) and that they can be easily scaled to systems of varying complexity.  The second is tackled by using a global, derivative-free optimiser â€” meaning that the controller may tackle mixed integer problems and incorporate arbitrary output constraints expressed as penalty functions.  A theoretical third problem arises due to the interaction of the learning and optimisation components of the controller. A methodology for tackling this is given. When applied to a simulated monovalent heating system in an unoccupied house (in the absence of user disturbances) consistent control can be achieved. The effective rejection of user disturbances is an outstanding problem and is briefly discussed..</p>

So much so that it is now even possible to transition from e-sports to actual motor racing. Such models are not entirely accurate however. They prioritise stability in order to accommodate even the most unhinged driving, not to mention the janky input profile of a keyboard or controller.</p>

This necessitates routinely recentralising or "washing out" the cockpit in order to have room for the next manoeuvre. Ideally, this recentering is carried out at a small enough acceleration that it is imperceptible to the driver - too high and the risk of motion sickness greatly increases.</p>
